#ITG Controller
I had a machine running in a gaming center, and I had to develop several things using my mobile phone through SSH in order to give some control over the machine to the venue owner.

This code is the one that is here, a really simple Sinatra application that executes bash scripts in order to let him control things on the machine with his mobile phone.

The supported features are:
- Volume changing
- OpenITG theme switcher
- Game reset
- Panic -> Puts the volume to a low value

As a curious point, I had to develop so much code of this app using the mobile phone I had on that time, a Motorola Moto G XT1032
